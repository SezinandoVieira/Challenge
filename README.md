# Challenge
This repository was created to try and complete Bry's challenge. 

## About Terraform

In this section I created the main file ([https://github.com/SezinandoVieira/Challenge/blob/master/Terraform/main.tf](main.tf) that will be responsible for building the infrastructure, which in the case of this challenge, I chose Azure. All the resources are modularized and are called from the main.tf file

I chose this provider because I had never worked with it and was curious to know how the tool and its resources worked


## About the API

Regarding the API, I took a very simple example just to show how the application would be dockerized and what it would look like

### Disclaimer

I did all this based on the knowledge I obtained during my previous experience and just researching some subjects and objectives to be able to create this "skeleton" of what was asked in the challenge.
